## Windows

To run something when starting up a program, in its Properties add `/k path\to\script.bat` after the command


## Cmd / Batch

Virtual drive on windows
`subst w: C:\work`

`set` All env variables

`set ENV_VAR=value` Sets env variable

`D:` goes into drive `D`

`cd D:\path\to\dir` changes working directory for drive D (does not cd into it unless you are on that drive)

`cd` is `pwd`

`type` is `cat`

`dir` is `ls`


`@echo off` to not output when running the script

`call path\to\script.bat` to run another batch

`Rem comment`

`C-x C-s` Save buffer

`C-x C-w` Save as...

`C-x c` Exit emacs

`C-x d` Open Dired, Emacs' file explorer (use `n`, `p` to navigate, `RET` to open the selected file, `C` to copy, `D` to delete, `d` (`u`) to mark (unmark) for deletion - executed with `x` -, `R` to rename, `!` to execute shell command on file)

`C-x k` Close single buffer

### Navigation
`C-p` `C-n` Move up Move down

`C-a` `C-e` Move to start of line Move to end of line

`M-a` `M-e` Move to start of sentence Move to end of sentence

`C-b` `C-f` Move back Move forward

`M-b` `M-f` Move back 1 word Move forward 1 word

`C-s` Search forward (Repeat `C-s` to move between results. `C-r` to move back)

`C-r` Search backwards

`C-M-s` Regex search (whitespace `\s` is `\s-`, for `\d` use `[0-9]`)

### Editing (moving stuff)
`C-x h` Select all buffer

`C-SPACE` Start selection mode

`C-w` Cut/Kill (= copy to kill ring, aka clipboard)

`M-w` Copy

`C-y` Paste (yank)

`M-y` Substitute last pasted with previous copied thing (pops yank stack)

`C-x r s a` Save selection to a register called 'a' (can choose any single character as a name)

`C-x r i a` Paste back the named (called 'a') selection
n
`M-x replace-string` Replace string

`BACK` (`BACKSPACE` or `DEL` in Emacsish) `C-d` (or `Del`) Delete backwards and forward

`C-BACKSPACE` `M-d` Kill word backward Kill word forward (as in bash shell)

`M-0 C-k` `C-k` Kill to beginning of line Kill to end of line (like bash `C-U`, `C-Y`. `C-k` doesn't kill newline unless `kill-whole-line` != `nil`)

`C-x BACKSPACE` `M-k` Kill to beginning of **sentence** Kill to end of **sentence** (Kinda like bash `C-U` and `C-Y`)

`M-\` `M-SPC` Clears all whitespace around point (aka cursor) (`M-SPC` leaves 1 space)

`C-x C-o` Clears all whitelines around point, leaving 1 ("line-version" of `M-SPC`)

### Editing (inserting stuff and code specific)
`C-x C-;` Toggle comment line (overwritten in my .emacs so not to move point at newline)

### Help
`C-h m` Help

`C-h k` What command is bound to a key

`C-h w` What key is bound to a command

### Commands and extensions
`M-x` Open minibuffer for executing command that you type (e.g. `M-x` and then `load-file`)

`.emacs` Config file for emacs. Loaded at startup with `-q -l path/to/.emacs` option

`(function arg1 arg2)` Lisp syntax for applying functions

`(defun funcname () body)` Function definition

`(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-;") 'myfunc)` Set a (global) key binding

`M-x load-file` Reloads a file (e.g. .emacs)

`C-i` is the same as `Tab`, `C-m` is the same as `Esc`

## Visual Studio

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build>vcvars64.bat` sets up developer environment (allowing to use `cl` from CLI)

`devenv` is Visual Studio IDE on CLI

`devenv path\to\executable.exe`

`cl /Zi file.cpp` compile with debug info

Set working directory from VS settings

`cl` compiles by default in ANSI mode. Functions from Windows API are actually all macros that are substituted with their equivalent ending in A or in W based on whether you compile in ANSI mode or in UTF mode.

`F9` Toggle breakpoint

`F11` Launch VS debugger

`OutputDebugStringA()` logs to debug console

## Windows Development

[WinMain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-winmain) entry point to windows

WinMain is called by CRT (C runtime library. Not part of Windows, but of everything needed to ship a C compiler. Google for more info)

Use [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us) or [windows docs](https://docs.microsoft.com)

To see what header to include to have some piece of code available, see "Header" at the end of the documentation page on MSDN. Same thing for libraries to link.

Windows uses Hungarian notation (every identifier is prefixed by its type, e.g. dwStyle means variable Style of type DWORD).

`windows.h` header to interact with windows

Microsoft compiler: `cl`

As a build system we are using a simple bat script which can be called from anywhere. E.g. from Emacs, or from a Command Prompt (but we need to have executed the vcvars64.bat script that sets up the VS environment).

All libraries to be linked are specified in the batch build script.

Every time we want to debug we need to rebuild our project by running the bat script

Windows defines its own [data types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)
